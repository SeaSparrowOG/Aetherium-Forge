# Aetherium-Forge
A simple wabbajack list that is aimed at mod authors.


This is a list designed to make the first steps towards becoming a mod author less annoying. It provides a fully configured environment through which the end user should be able to make most kinds of mods, while maintaining the cleanliness of the root game folder.

Prerequisites

i. Make sure that the Steam library you're installing Skyrim into is NOT inside the Program Files or Program Files (x86) directories.
If it is, you will need to use a tool, like Dragonist's Steam Library Setup Tool. Link:

ii. It is strongly recommended that you use an archive program, like 7zip or Winrar. I recommend 7zip, since it's free.



# Installation

# Part 1 - Clean Skyrim Install

i. Navigate to <Steam>\steamapps\common and delete the "Skyrim Special Edition" folder.
  
ii. Navigate to your Documents folder, then enter "My Games" and delete the "Skyrim Special Edition" folder.
  
iii. Press the Windows Key + R. Type in AppData and press Enter. Navigate to Local, and delete the "Skyrim Special Edition" folder.
  
iv. Open Steam. Go to your library and uninstall Skyrim Special Edition.
  
v. Install Skyrim. Make SURE that you are not installing in Program Files or Program Files (x86).
  
  
Optional i. Navigate to where you installed Skyrim and pin the folder to your quick access ribbon.
  

# Part 2 - Installing the Creation Kit
  
i. Open Steam. Go to your Library.
  
ii. Under "Home", click where it says "Games", and make sure that "Software" is enabled.
  
iii. In the search box, type in "Creation Kit", and click on "Skyrim Special Edition: Creation Kit".
  
iv. Press install.
  
v. Once the installation finishes, navigate to your Skyrim installation location and find the creation kit executable.
  
vi. Right click it, and press "Run as Administrator". This is necessary.
  
vii. If a window pops up saying that the Scripts folder is new and asks you to unpack it, press yes. This takes a few minutes.
  
      
# Part 3 - Installing the List
    
i. You now have everything you need to install the Aetherium Forge. Download the Aetherium Forge.Wabbajack file from this repository.
  
ii. Go to Wabbajack.org and download the Wabbajack executable. Move it to a folder of your choosing, outside of the common folders.
Recommendation: Move it to C:\Wabbajack

iii. Run the Wabbajack executable so it can update.
  
iv. Close the Wabbajack executable.
  
v. Double click the Aetherium Forge.wabbajack file.
  
vi. You will need to fill in Installation Location and Download Location. I recommend a central Download location, so other lists
can use these files, or if you have other lists installed, Aetherium Forge to use your already downloaded files.
  
vii. For Installation Location, I recommend the following: C:\Aetherium Forge
  
viii. Press the Play button, and follow the installer. If you have Nexus premium, everything should be automated.
